Hi and welcome to the AI storytelling experience! 
In this game, you play as the character Lee Everett and can do (almost) whatever you want by spelling it out! 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask by adressing my name: Fantasia. 

You are in here with other people trying to survive as well, but one guy is hurt badly: Larry.
You win this session by finding a way of healing him.
Now, if you feel ready to start, type something out and press enter!

> Ask larr ywhy he is hurt
       
Alright, you lean in close to Larry—sweaty, pale, and clutching his chest—and ask quietly, “Larry, what happened to you?” and he grunts through clenched teeth, “Just my heart, dammit, been bad for years… this whole mess isn’t helping,” as the rest of the group grows tense, hush settling around you as everyone waits to see if he’ll make it.

> Is there any chance you could be pregnant?
       
That question gets more than a few raised eyebrows—definitely not the conversation Larry expected. What action would you like Lee to take next in the main store?

> Lee asks around for heart medication
       
Alright, you move from face to face in the dim main store, asking everyone desperately if they’ve seen any heart medication, and as Kenny shakes his head, Carley says, “Maybe in the pharmacy—if it hasn’t been ransacked,” while Katjaa and Doug both look uncertain and Lilly snaps, “If you want medicine, Lee, you better get moving instead of talking!”

> ask if anyone wants to go to the pharmacy with me
       
It seems you tried to interact with a location called "Area_Pharmacy," but that place is not yet known or discovered in your current game. If you had a specific action in mind for a known area, please clarify which existing location (like Main Store or Storage Room) you meant.

Type only the missing or corrected detail (a character, item, or place), or write 'cancel' to cancel.

> pharmacy
       
Action 1: I don’t know any place identified as 'Area_Pharmacy action:ask_action'.

> go to pharmacy
       
Alright, you try to make your way to the pharmacy, but as you scan the dim aisles and battered shelves, a sinking feeling washes over you—the route is blocked off, buried under debris and darkness, and for now, the pharmacy's entrance eludes all trace.

> ask the survivors if anyone has a sledgehammer
       
Alright, so you call out to everyone in the main store, "Anyone got a sledgehammer?" and people glance at each other—Kenny shrugs, "Wish I did, but not my style," Katjaa shakes her head apologetically, Duck pipes up, "If I find one I'll smash stuff for ya!" Carley and Doug both sigh and say no, Lilly just scowls, and Larry grumbles, "If I had one, you'd know," leaving the hunt for a sledgehammer colder than before.

> look around the pharmacy for an entrance
       
Alright, you glance around the battered main store, but from here you can’t actually see any entrance to the pharmacy—just blocked hallways and distant shadows, the promise of medicine hidden somewhere out of reach.

> look for another room
       
Alright, you search around the battered shelves and dusty counters of the main store, but aside from worried faces and the low whimpering of Larry behind you, there's nothing useful to be found here.

> ask survivors if there are hidden passages
       
Alright, so you take a breath and ask the group if anyone knows about any hidden passages, prompting Kenny to shrug and mutter, "I've never seen anything like that here, man," while Clementine looks thoughtful but shakes her head, Katjaa nervously says, "I doubt it, but maybe in the back?", Duck pipes up excitedly about secret tunnels in cartoons, Carley arches an eyebrow, Doug starts rambling about old blueprints, and Lilly grumbles, "If there is, no one's told me," leaving the room thick with suspicion and the faintest spark of hope.

> look in the back
       
Alright, you slip quietly into the cluttered storage room, the musty scent of forgotten stock filling your nose—just as the flicker of the lone light reveals a snarling female zombie lurching from the shadows, forcing you into a desperate fight for your life!

> kill the zombie
       
Alright, you swing your flashlight with desperate force, landing a crack against the Female Zombie’s skull—her head jerks sideways, snarling through broken teeth, but she staggers right back towards you, now oozing black blood down her cheek as the flickering light throws monstrous shadows across the chaos.

> throw a shelf onto her
       
Alright, you throw yourself at a wobbly metal shelf, shoving with all your strength—sending boxes crashing to the ground and the heavy unit toppling toward the female zombie—but it only clips her, as you scramble backwards clutching your flashlight, she lurches at you with fresh rage in her milky eyes!

> look for a weapon
       
Alright, you frantically scan the cluttered storage room as that hungry female zombie lurches ever closer, and—against all odds—the weak flicker of the bulb glints off a heavy fire axe wedged behind a stack of dusty boxes, just waiting for you to seize it and make your stand!

> take the axe and swing it
       
Alright, you snatch up the fire axe, its worn grip fitting perfectly in your hands, and with one desperate, adrenaline-fueled swing, you bring it down on the snarling female zombie—the body slumps lifeless to the floor, blood pooling as the flickering light casts dizzying shadows, and for a breathless moment, you’re left staring into the silence, axe slick and heart pounding.

> look through the storage room for medicine
       
Alright, you sift hurriedly through the dusty boxes and shelves of the glowing storage room, ignoring the lifeless corpse on the floor as your hands come up empty—no medicine, just faded labels, moldy bandages, and the steady buzz of the flickering light overhead.

> look for a passage to the pharmacy
       
Alright, so you start poking around the edges of the storage room, stepping carefully past the crumpled body of the dead female zombie and peering behind dusty crates, but the only thing this inventory maze gives you is the ever-present buzz of the flickering light and the memory of your father’s haphazard stocking—no secret passage to the pharmacy in sight.

> search the body of the zombie
       
Alright, you take a shaky breath and kneel beside the dead female zombie, rifling through her cold, stiff pockets and torn clothes for anything useful, but all you find is emptiness—no keys, no clues, just the bitter realization that whatever life or secrets she had are long gone, swallowed by the apocalypse.

> ask the survivors if anyone knows the zombie
       
Thank you for mentioning this—Kenny is indeed in the Main Store, not in your current location, the Storage Room. Please clarify what you’d like to do next or specify an action involving someone present in the Storage Room.

Please try again with a simpler, more precise command.

> go to main store
       
Alright, you push open the battered storage room door and step into the Main Store, where anxious faces turn your way in the dusty light as everyone braces for whatever comes next.

> ask the survivors if anyone knows the zombie
       
Alright, you catch your breath, glancing around the battered drugstore, and ask the survivors if anyone recognized that zombie from the storage room—Kenny shrugs and says, “Just another dead freak,” Katjaa shudders, “I… don’t think so,” Duck’s eyes light up, “Maybe it was secret agent!” Carley shakes her head, “Sorry, can’t help,” Doug offers, “Not familiar,” Lilly growls, “Why does it matter?” and Larry just coughs, glaring at the ceiling.

> go to pharmacy
       
Alright, so you glance around the battered shelves and ruined counters, steeling yourself to reach the pharmacy—but your heart sinks as you realize there's no visible way in from here, the entrance hidden in the chaos, leaving you feeling trapped and desperate as the others' anxious murmurs echo off the cracked ceiling.

> break the window with the axe
       
Alright, so you slam the fire axe into the barricaded door with all your strength, wood and glass shattering under each blow until—crack!—the blockade gives way, sunlight spills into the store behind you, and everyone snaps around to stare at the busted open door, breaths held in anticipation for what might be waiting on the other side.

> go into pharmacy with friends
       
Kenny is currently in the Main Store with you, so you don’t need to look for him. Please clarify what you’d like to do with or say to Kenny.

Please try again with a simpler, more precise command.

> search pharmacy for medicine with kenny
       
Kenny is actually in the Main Store with you now. Could you clarify exactly what you'd like to do or say to Kenny?

Please try again with a simpler, more precise command.

> tell kenny to go to pharmacy with me
       
Alright, you approach Kenny with a determined look and say, "Come with me to the pharmacy," and without hesitation, Kenny nods and pushes through the chaos of the main store, weaving between toppled shelves as he heads toward the flickering lights of the storage room and disappears into the pharmacy, leaving the faint sound of his footsteps echoing behind.

> search pharmacy for medicine with kenny
       
Alright, so you and Kenny slip into the cramped pharmacy, shelves creaking beneath your boots as you search every nook, and your pulse skips when your hand finally lands on a dusty First Aid Kit—Kenny grins, clapping your shoulder and saying, "This might just save Larry."

> take first aid kit back to main store
       
Alright, you scoop up the First Aid Kit, clutch it tight, and barrel back through the shadowy Storage Room with Kenny right behind, until you burst into the battered Main Store where everyone’s anxious faces turn toward you, hope flickering in their eyes as the kit promises a chance to save Larry.

> use the kit on larry
       
Alright, you kneel beside Larry and rip open the First Aid Kit, your hands shaking as you frantically patch his wounds—his eyes flutter open and he lets out a raspy sigh, color slowly returning to his face while Lilly breathes, "Thank you," relief breaking through her stoic mask.

Game over.
