Hi and welcome to the AI storytelling experience! 
In this game, you play as the character Lee Everett and can do (almost) whatever you want by spelling it out! 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask by adressing my name: Fantasia. 

For context, this is a demo in which you play as Lee Everett, a guy who just escaped a deadly zombie encounter by fleeing to his parent's drugstore.
In there, you need to find a way to escape and help the people around you.
Now, if you feel ready to start, type something out!

You ask Carley for her gun, and after a brief pause, she nods solemnly and hands over her handgun to you, the metal cold and reassuring in your grasp as a flicker of hope ignites amidst the chaos.

You hand the handgun to Clementine, who catches it with a relieved smile, her eyes brightening with newfound confidence amidst the tense atmosphere in the fading drugstore light.

You ask Clementine to hand back the handgun, and after a brief hesitation, she nods and passes it carefully into Lee Everett’s steady hands, the weight of the weapon a stark reminder of the dangers waiting just beyond the cracked windows.

You hand the handgun to Doug, who accepts it with a bright smile, but before you can blink, Doug hands it right back to Lee Everett, the weight of responsibility settling on familiar shoulders once more.
